# infoBit
React SPA for Cryptocurrencies info using Stateful Components

*For Run Server, type:*
### `npm start`

# No budget API
infoBit consumes two APIs, of which the main one is consumed from the client side, making the graphical tracking of cryptocurrencies begin to take effect as soon as the page is visited.

*You can support this project with a "grain of sand" on Patreon and be able to fund the API in real time in the backend to give the maximum experience.*
